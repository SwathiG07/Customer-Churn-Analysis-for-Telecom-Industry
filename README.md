Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Industry

Overview:

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using SQL and machine learning.

The goal is to predict churn, identify key drivers, and support data-driven retention strategies.

Tools Used:

SQL (DB Browser for SQLite)

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)

SHAP (Explainable AI)

What Was Done:

Processed and engineered features using SQL

Built churn prediction models in Python

Evaluated models using recall and ROC-AUC

Used SHAP to explain churn drivers

Created a final presentation with insights and recommendations

Files:

churn.csv – Original dataset

churn_model.sql – SQL queries

churn_sql_features.csv – Feature-engineered dataset

churn_model.ipynb – ML and SHAP analysis

Customer Churn Analysis.pptx – Final presentation

Outcome:

Identified high-risk customers and key churn drivers to enable proactive retention strategies.
